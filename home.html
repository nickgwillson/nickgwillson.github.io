                    Hi! I'm Nick Willson, an engineer based in Boulder, who specializes as a software engineer and web developer.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Recently I worked with Lionsgate to help them build front-end based extension attachments for Adobe's Premiere Pro and Media Encoder. 
                    Currently I am seeking an entry level software developer/engineer position, and in my free time I've been learning more about backend support 
                    for websites, as well as breaking in my new pizza oven.

                </p><br>
                <p>
                    I am a very extroverted and happy person, who is passionante about engineering, coding, art and cooking. I love the process that comes with 
                    programming a project (as long as the screen-brightness is half way), and now that I am armed with a degree in computer science I hope that I
                    can combine my need to create with the joy of doing something meaningful.

                    <p>
                       For this program I wanted to make a quick extension that Starz's video editors could use to quickly and efficiently change all the specs
                        of their video clips within one easy-to-use extension. This idea came about after talking with the head of the post-production team in
                        which he confided in me how annoying it could be to have to go through and change the specs of every single clip in a trailer in order to
                        get it ready for multiple platforms (width, height, aspect ratio, resolution,n etc.), so I made the above program in order to change all
                        of the video specs of a clip in the push of a button.

                        Adobe Premiere Pro is a great tool for video editing, but it can lack some other features that are common on other platforms, such as a 
                        find and replace. This program was a one-stop for all common features where editors could go and do a whole variety of different actions
                        on to their video clips. This took up most of my time when working at STARZ but by the end I was able to make the following features....
                        find and replace, prefix / suffix adder,  remove (text), and a video spec editor. These features can be applied to either a video clip,
                        video folder, image layer, text layer, or comps (which are composed clips) and have the choice of being case-sensitive to upper and lower
                        case.

                    <p>
                        My manager gave me the task of helping an employee who was having  to manually edit, change the specs of, and encode (render) hundreds of 
                        videos stored on the company's servers, and asked if I could lend a hand. I created a program which would take in a CSV file containing the
                        path to the video, the audio for that video, along with the frame rate and dimensions. After creating this CSV file you simply open my Adobe
                        extension, upload the CSV file, and watch while my program will automatically combine the video with the audio, change the specs to the
                        correct frame rate and dimensions, render this video, encode it, and then send all the finalized videos to a folder of your choosing.

                <div class="card">
                    <p>For this program I was tasked with preparing movie clips for localization. Localization is what happens when a video needs translation 
                        into other languages. For this I was tasked with making the process of preparing a video for localization easier for the editors. Normally 
                        the steps for localizing a clip is finding the clips that contain the original language, adding the language it needs to be translated into
                        unto these clips,  and then put that edited clip back into the video sequence and doing this for every language needed. Well I thought that 
                        just sounded like to many steps, so I created a program in which the editors only needed to open my extension, select the clips that need
                        translation, and tell the extension what languages you want to turn it into. From here my program does the rest of the work, and puts all
                        the videos now ready to be sent to the translation team in a nice neat folder on your desktop (or wherever you'd like).

                    <p>
                        For this project my team and I were in charge of doing an entire overhaul of the website building bridges. We were tasked with changing 
                        all the aspects of the sight that needed to be addressed in order to facilitate the use of the sight for people with disabilities. These 
                        disabilities including things such as poor vision, color or full blindness, or inability to use a keyboard or mouse. This is very important
                        for a website, and is something a lot of websites can overlook. The process of redesigning a website starts with using an extension tool on
                        your browser to identify problems such as contrast or structural errors. We then go about fixing the internal HTML of the website to
                        facilitate use by the disabled, and then restructure the styling of the sight so that all contrast errors are gone, as well as making 
                        it overall easier to navigate via alternative measures, which include correct header structuring and detailed yet brief content descriptions.

                        These were some of the first extensions created for Adobe's PPRO and Encoder. The purpose of these three extensions where to make some 
                        of the most common tasks in an editors life just a little bit faster and easier. The first extension seen in this video is simply a catch
                        all for what an editor might need, whether it be how many clips or words are in a video, or to upload a template for title cards, or to 
                        create the defaulted setup an editor might start with. The last two extensions are just to shorten the number of buttons that editors 
                        needed to press when either exporting bins (which are video folders), which can be mightly useful time-savers.

                Developed, tested, and launched Adobe panel extensions for STARZ's entire production team as the sole developer.
                My primary objective was to streamline workflow processes by creating panel extensions that reduced the number of 
                repetitive tasks performed by the team. Within two weeks, I quickly acquired knowledge of unique industry practices 
                and over a period of four months, successfully developed and created seven independent, ready-to-publish Adobe extensions. 
                My work resulted in increased productivity for the production team and improved overall efficiency.
