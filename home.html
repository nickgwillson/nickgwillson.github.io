                    Hi! I'm Nick Willson, an engineer based in Boulder, who specializes as a software engineer and web developer.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Recently I worked with Lionsgate to help them build front-end based extension attachments for Adobe's Premiere Pro and Media Encoder. 
                    Currently I am focused on finding my next big project, and in my free time I've been learning more about backend support for websites, along with how
                    to make webpages more accessible for people with disabilities. As well as breaking in my new pizza oven.

                </p><br>
                <p>
                    I am a very extroverted and happy person, who is passionante about engineering, coding, art and cooking. I love the process that comes with 
                    programming a project (as long as the screen-brightness is half way), and now that I am armed with a degree in computer science I hope that I
                    can combine my need to create with the joy of doing something meaningful.

                    <p>
                        For this program I wanted to make a quick extension that the video editors could use to quickly and efficiently change all the specs of their video clips
                        within one easy to use extension. This idea came about after interviewing the head of the post-production team in which he confided in me how annoying it
                        could be to have to go through and change the specs of every single clip in a trailer in order to get it ready for multiple platforms (think of the differences
                        in width, height, and resolution between a youtube video and a tiktok video), so I made the above program in order to change all of the video specs of a clip in
                        the push of a button.

                    <p>
                        Although Adobe Premiere Pro is a great tool for video editing, and can be lacking some common features we are use to, such as a find and replace. This program
                        was my most complicated one yet, in which I tried to make a one stop for all extensions where editors could go and do a whole variety of different actions on their
                        video clips. This took up most of my time when working at STARZ, but was worth it. I was able to make a find and replace, a prefix and suffix adder, a remove all text,
                        and a change video spec options. All of which can either be used on video clip, Video folders, image layers , text layers, and comps (which are multiple clips seemed together)
                        and have the choice of being case-sensitive to upper and lower case.

                <div class="card">
                    <p>
                        One day my manager came up to me and told me that he learned that there was an employee down in the basement having to manually edit, change the specs of,
                        and encode (render) hundreds of videos stored on the company servers, and asked if I could lend a hand. I created a program which takes in a CSV file
                        containing the path of the video on our server, as well as the audio your want for that video, along with the frame rate and dimensions you want the
                        video to be into. After creating this CSV file you simply open my Adobe extension, upload the CSV file, and watch while my program will automatically
                        combine the video with the audio, change the specs to the correct frame rate and dimensions, render this video, encode it, and then send all the
                        finalized videos to a folder of your choosing. This one was real difficultt but very satisfying once I got it working.

                <h2>Video Localization</h2>
                <div class="card">
                    <p>
                        For this program I was tasked with preparing movie clips for localization, which is what happes when an movie needs translations into other languages. For this
                        program I was tasked with making the process of preparing a video for localization easier for the editors. Normally what happens when an editor is localizing a clip is
                        that he would have to find all the clips that contain english lets say, grab these clips and export them, then go to each clip and add the name of the language it needs
                        to be translated into, but that edited clip back into the sequence (movie/trailer/eg.) and then send this whole sequence to a folder with the name of the needed language
                        translation, and do this for every language needed. Well I thought that just sounded like to many stepe, so I created a program in which all the editors need to do is
                        open my extension, select the clips that need translation, and tell the extension what languages you want to turn it into. From here my program does the rest of the work,
                        and puts all the videos now ready to be sent to the translation team in a nice neat folder on your desktop (or wherever you'd like)

                    <p>
                        For this project my team and I were in charge of doing an entire overhaul of the website building bridges. We were tasked with changing all the aspects
                        of the sight that needed to be changed in order to facilitate the use of the sight people with disabilities, with disabilities including things such as poor
                        vision or unable to use a mouse/scroll wheel. This is very important for a website, and is something a lot of people overlook. The process of redesigning a
                        website starts with using an extension tool on your browser to identify problems such as contrast or structural errors. We then go about fixing the internal HTML
                        of the website to facilitate use by the disabled, and then restructure the styling of the sight so that all contrast errors are gone, as well as making it overall easier
                        to navigate.

                        These were some of the first extensions created for Adobe's PPRO and Encoder. The purpose of these three extensions where to make some of the most common
                        tasks in an editors life just a little bit fast. The first extension seen in this video is simply a catch all for what an editor might need, whether it be how
                        many clips or words are in a video, or to upload a template for title cards, or to create the defaulted STARZ editor set up. The last two extensions are just to shorten
                        the number of buttons that editors needed to press when either exporting bins (which are simply folders with videos inside), or creating them, and although they seem quite simply
                        in both appearence and technicality, they can be mightly useful time-savers.
